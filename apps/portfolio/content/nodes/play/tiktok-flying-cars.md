# Flying Cars

We keep waiting for "flying cars" as a sign of the future.

But we already have them. We just call them airplanes.

This short video is a playful reminder: sometimes the future we're waiting for is already here. We just haven't shifted our perception enough to notice.

## The Design Insight

**Framing matters.** The same technology becomes magical or mundane depending on how we frame it.

As designers, we're not just building features—we're framing experiences. We're choosing what to make visible, what to emphasize, what to make feel magical.

The technology might be the same. The experience can be completely different.
