# Komorebi - Light Through Leaves

**Komorebi** (木漏れ日) is a Japanese word that describes sunlight filtering through tree leaves.

There's no direct English translation—which tells you something about what we choose to name and notice.

This short video captures a quiet moment of komorebi on a morning walk. It's a reminder to slow down and pay attention to the small, fleeting moments of beauty that surround us.

## Why This Matters

Design isn't just about interfaces and user flows. It's about **perception**—training ourselves to notice what's already beautiful, what's already working, what deserves our attention.

The best designers I know are the ones who notice komorebi.
