# SetSail - Revenue Intelligence Platform

## Role
Lead Product Designer

## Timeline
2022-2023

## The Challenge

Sales teams struggle to understand which activities actually drive revenue. Traditional CRMs capture data but don't reveal patterns or provide actionable insights.

SetSail needed to transform complex sales data into clear, actionable intelligence that would help teams win more deals.

## The Solution

I led the design of SetSail's revenue intelligence platform, focusing on:

1. **Intuitive Data Visualization** - Transformed complex sales metrics into clear, scannable dashboards
2. **Actionable Insights** - AI-powered recommendations presented at the right time in the workflow
3. **Team Collaboration** - Features that connected individual performance to team goals

## Key Features

- **Activity Intelligence Dashboard** - Real-time view of which activities correlate with closed deals
- **Deal Health Scoring** - Predictive analytics to identify at-risk opportunities
- **Coaching Workflows** - Tools for managers to provide targeted guidance based on data

## Results

- **40% increase** in platform engagement
- **Positive user feedback** from sales teams on clarity and usefulness
- **Reduced time-to-insight** from days to minutes

## Design Philosophy in Action

This project embodied **Transparent by Design**—making AI recommendations explainable and **User Control**—letting teams customize what they track and how they view it.
